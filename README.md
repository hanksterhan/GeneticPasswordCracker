# Password Cracker with Genetic Algorithms
In this project, I learned how to implement genetic algorithms by creating a password cracker. I also learned how to create a Dash application using Plotly's Dash library built on Plotly.js, React, and Flask.

## Installation
Run the following command to install all the required packages, runs in both python2 and python3

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To launch the Dash Application, run the following command: 

    python app.py

The genetic algorithm is only executed when the "RUN" button is clicked, so users are free to change values without worrying about runtime constraints. The generated graph is also interactive.
